## Projects and Activities

### Fruitpunch Seal Face Recognition (2023)

Volunteer activity in fruitpunch, helping our partner from Colgate
University in researching non-invasive tracking for Seal. That is using
their facial feature in order to identify individual seal, and tracking
their activity around certain area. I'm involved in the face recognition
team, building algorithm to determine if a picture of a seal is the one
already observed or a new individual Seal. We're Using EfficientNet as
backbone, and using the output as embedding.

### Text Recognition and Detection Survey (2022)
In JAIR, we were building a dataset of receipts captured using phone
camera, in order to have clear direction we try to summarize current
state of Scanned Receipt OCR and IE. We're planning on publishing it in
national conference and currently published preprint.

### Machine Learning for Stupidious (2017)
Introduction to Machine Learning for Artist using Wekinator is a talk
and workshop I gave back in 2017 in order to break down the barrier of
using machine learning for creating art. This talk was addressed for
people with little to no knowledge.

## Technical Strengths

-   Experience at using **Python 3** used in analysing business data,
    build and train Machine Learning models (sklearn, pytorch and
    pandas), managing and optimizing data warehouse (BigQuery,
    Clickhouse), and presenting the result of research in BI tools (Data
    Studio, Redash, Metabase) and Notebooks (Jupyter)
-   Experience in **building Machine Learning models** to reproduce
    models and its result for both academic research and real world
    project (using pytorch or tensorflow). Also building data pipeline
    using orchestration tools (Apache Airflow, Prefect) and data
    versioning tools (DVC)
-   Familiar in using **Docker** to containerize Machine Learning model
    and deploy it to managed container service (using Google Cloud Run)
-   Using **Linux environment** for daily development, which entails
    intensive uses of git, and common Linux CLI tools.
